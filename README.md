I refractored this websit in order for it to be more accessible by people who may be visually impaired.

## Why?

I did this project, because of my passion for coding and web development. I also appreciate the concept of making websites more accessible to those with imapairments.

## Problem solving

This website was created to educate users on search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. 

## What did you learn?

I learned the definitons and purpose of many coding elements, attributes, classes, and syntax both in HTML and CSS. I also learned how import it is for a website to be in semantic formating for people who may be visually impaired.

## What makes your project stand out?

My project stands out because I went into extra detail during the commenting section in order to ensure my understanding for the coding elements, attributes, classes, and syntax. This website will serve as a reference for when I need to refer back to fundamentals.
